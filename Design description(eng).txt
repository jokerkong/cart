description of function design

The observer mode was chosen on the basis that a message notification is issued whenever the order status of the shopping cart changes, and that it should not only notify the new component.
And since the project will need to send reports through different channels in the future, the components that send reports on this product think it makes sense to use a policy pattern design.

Use observer mode for message publishing
rtOrderMsg.java  -- Publisher (observed)
CurrentOrderStatusDisplay.java --observer

The release mode USES the policy pattern (considering that the requirement body will add other channel releases later)
SendReport.java Abstract  class for sending mode
SendReportByEmail.java    The implementation class for the abstract class SendReport

SendBehavior.java --Transmission mode interface
EmailChannel.java --An implementation class for the send mode interface

others 
IsWithinTm.java  --Determine whether the time is within 5 minutes (to be optimized)
